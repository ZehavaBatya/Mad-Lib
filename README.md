# Celeberity Mad Lib
The Mad Lib game is a written and storytelling actiivty for children, teenagers, and adults between 2 or more playeres. 1 player can play, if need be, but the anticipation
and laughter is traced with the group play setting. The objective of a mad lib is for 1 player to input the option choices of a noun, adjective, verb, or adverb. Then player
2 gives a noun, adjective, verb, or adverb of his or her choosing. Finally, player 1 reads back the story in its entirety with fill-ins from player 2.
